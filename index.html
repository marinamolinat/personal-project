        <h2>What's Cybersecurity?  </h2>
        
        <p>As the name states, cybersecurity is a field that focuses on security in networks and computer systems. This includes our beloved phones, computers, accounts, and personal information. Even if the use of technology has exponentially increased, awareness of cybersecurity hasn't kept up. People are often misinformed and too naive.  </p>

        <h3>(Not so)  FUN FACT: Every 39 seconds, a hacker attack occurs. Its estimated that 1 in 3 americans are affected yearly because of poor cybersecurity</h3>

        <h2>People are dumb</h2>
        <img src="dumb.gif">
        
       
        <p>Just kidding. They actually aren't, just misinformed. We are rarely taught about cybersecurity,
             the idea of cybersecurity in the media is largely distorted. Movies and shows portray it inaccurately, making it seem as something incomprehensible,
             largely complex, and completely abstract. Even if cybersecurity is no easy field, its basics can be learned easily. If awareness is created, less people will fall victim to attacks. </p>

        <h2>Demostration of it dangers</h2>
        <p>For the sake of education, and to demonstrate how scarily easy it is for a hacker to get access to accounts, I decided to try, consensually, to hack some friends. 
            Even though most were quite reluctant, after agreeing to some terms, two of them decided to volunteer. In this test to evaluate their cybersecurity and their practices, I was to try to get in to thier school's google accounts,
            while they tried for that not to happend. Fun, right? My plan was to launch 3 attacks that increased gradully in difficulty for me, and to evade aswell.

        <h2>*Panics* What now?</h2>
        <img src="peepo-nervous.gif">
        <p>Firstly, the simple solution: to teach and educate others about cybersecurity. We are often taught about how to stay safe at parties, 
            in solitude dark streets, plane crashes, in fires, dog fights, etc. Yet falling victim to a cyberattack can be more likely than a lot of those, 
            and we are rarely taught about hat. Yes, sometimes we are reminded to have strong passwords and to not fall for online scams,
             however there are much information that should still be taught: Such as phishing sites, keyloggers, breaches, etc.       </p>
